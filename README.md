# Too Much Code
Too Much Code is just a test app with a few cool things sometimes. Take the code it's free if you credit me.

## Stuff in it
There's [Live Activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit/displaying-live-data-with-live-activities), with notified updates. There's another Live Activity but with a [Gauge](https://sarunw.com/posts/swiftui-gauge/#accessorycircularcapacity). There's also a test for device connectivity, using the [Network API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network)

## Software Betas
This repository also includes the [new APIs](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/Too-Much-Code/tree/main/TMC/Beta) used in the beta softwares like iOS 18 or macOS Sequoia. They are unaccessible without using the appropriate version.
