# Too Much Code
Too Much Code is just a test app with a few cool things sometimes. Take the code it's free if you credit me.

## Stuff in it
There's [Live Activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit/displaying-live-data-with-live-activities), with notified updates. There's another Live Activity but with a [Gauge](https://sarunw.com/posts/swiftui-gauge/#accessorycircularcapacity). Not much to deal with currently in there...
